# Dashboard with Responsive Layout using SASS

This repository contains a dashboard built using the powerful CSS preprocessor SASS, along with a responsive layout. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for managing and visualizing data.

#### We will cover the following properties step by step:

## Features

**Responsive Design:** The dashboard is designed to work seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices. It dynamically adjusts its layout to provide an optimal user experience.

**SASS Preprocessor:** SASS is a powerful CSS preprocessor that allows you to write more maintainable and modular CSS code. It provides features like variables, mixins, and nesting, which can greatly enhance your styling workflow.

**Modular Architecture:** The dashboard follows a modular architecture, making it easy to add or modify components. Each component is encapsulated and can be reused throughout the application.

**Interactive Charts:** The dashboard includes interactive charts and graphs to visualize data in a meaningful way. You can easily customize and extend the charts to suit your specific needs.

**Easy Customization:** With SASS, you can customize the look and feel of the dashboard by simply modifying variables and mixins. This allows for easy theming and branding of the application.
